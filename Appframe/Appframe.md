6.7	T-SQL exercises
=====
1.	Create a new table using Appframe then write a T-SQL code to copy/add all missing Appframe roles with the permissions from an existing table to the new one.

    ```sql
    BEGIN TRAN
    UPDATE dbo.sviw_System_MyPermissions_CurrentDomain
        SET GrantDelete = t2.GrantDelete,
            GrantInsert = t2.GrantInsert,
            GrantUpdate = t2.GrantUpdate
        FROM
            (
            SELECT RoleID, GrantUpdate, GrantInsert, GrantDelete
                FROM dbo.sviw_System_MyPermissions_CurrentDomain
                WHERE TableName = 'atbl_Sales_Contacts'
            ) t2
        WHERE
            TableName = 'atbl_Sales_NewTable'
            AND RoleID = t2.RoleID
    COMMIT TRAN
    ```

2.	Return a list of Appframe roles, which allow a particular user to select data from a selected table using T-SQL.
    ```sql
    SELECT r.Title
        FROM stbl_System_RolesTables rt
        JOIN stbl_System_Roles r
            ON rt.RoleID = r.RoleID
        JOIN stbl_System_RolesMembers rm
            ON rt.RoleID = rm.RoleID
        WHERE
            TableName = 'atbl_Sales_NewTable' --[SELECTED TABLE]
            AND Login = 'developer@omega.no' --[PARTICLAR USER]
    ```

## MISC NOTES/TL;DR
- Naming Conventions/Best Practices USE EM
- Use CDL field if you updating a buncha stuff to skip all the data logging
- DON'T use FLOATS (duh) Use Decimals instead. THANKS!
- USE NVARCHAR(w/ unicode) instea of VARCHAR unless you worried about size.
- dd-MMM-yyyy is the DATETIME format to go with UTC zone indication
